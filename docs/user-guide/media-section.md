# Media Section
**********************

Media Section are similar to [Paragraph Sections](paragraph-section.md) but the main difference is that as soon as the user try to add a new Media Section, the [Media Editor Window](media-editor-window.md) appears, asking to define the media that is going to be added. An example of a new Media Section with an image added can be like the following:

<img src="../img/media-section/media-s.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

Once the first media is added to the Media Section it is possible to add new media or text content or remove the existing ones, just like in the [Paragraph Sections](paragraph-section.md).

## Text

Every time a text content is added to the section, the user can write his text and customize it through the [Text Editor Toolbar](text-editor-toolbar.md). A text content added just below an image, for example, can display like the following:

<img src="../img/media-section/media-img-txt.jpg" class="ms-docimage" style="width:500px"/>

## Media

Once a media content is added to the section, the user can customize its setting through the following:

* For images the [Content Image Toolbar](content-image-toolbar.md) appears. An example of a *Small* size image, aligned to the *Left*, can be the following: 

<img src="../img/media-section/media-img-set.jpg" class="ms-docimage" style="width:500px"/>
