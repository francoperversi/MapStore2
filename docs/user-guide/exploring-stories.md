# Exploring Stories
**********************

In [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/), the Story is a tool that allows you to express in a simple and dynamic way a concept, combining and connecting text, maps, images, video and other media as desired. The final result is an interactive flux of information that reflects user customizations.

The user can approach with a story in two different ways:

* Creating a new story or editing an existing one through the *Edit Mode*
* Enjoy the story and interact with it, through the *View Mode*

## Edit Mode

The *Edit Mode* allows the user to edit a story by adding, removing or modifying the elements inside it. This approach and its tools are used both to edit an existing story and to create a new one. <br>
In order to create a new story, the user can click on the **New Story** button <img src="../img/button/new-story.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> on [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) homepage. As soon as you perform this operation the workflow appears in *Edit Mode* and composed of two main elements: the *Builder* and the *Sections Container* (later simply called *Container*).

The information flux of the Story is organized in Sections, that can be added from the <img src="../img/button/add-section.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button on the bottom of the *Container*. In particular, the user can take advantage of four different types of sections:

* [Title Section](title-section.md)
* [Paragraph Section](paragraph-section.md)
* [Immersive Section](immersive-section.md)
* [Media Section](media-section.md)

## View Mode

The *View Mode* it is a way of approaching a story useful in cases where you would like to present the content of your work to someone, or simply every time you need to check up the progress of your work. <br>
The user can access the *View Mode* through the **Show preview** button <img src="../img/button/show-preview.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> in Builder's toolbar, and the first display is organized like the following:

Most of the page is occupied by a large display space, that can be navigated also through the Navigation bar on top-right of the story:

The user, scrolling through the story, can interact with it browsing and zooming the maps, or observing fullscreen images and videos with just one click:

In order to switch back to *Edit Mode*, there is the **Navigation edit** button <img src="../img/button/edit-icon-1.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> on top-left of the story.

## Save a Story

Both in edit mode and new mode, the user can save your story, through the option button <img src="../img/button/burger.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> on the top bar. If the story is not saved yet, there's only the possibility to perform the Save, but if a story was already saved it is possible to choose between Save and Save as. Saving a Story it is possible to define the following settings:
